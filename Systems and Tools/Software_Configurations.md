## Peachtree Accounting Registration Required: "You Must Register Now to Continue"

- **Issue**: Upon launching Peachtree Accounting, the error appears:  
  _"Register Peachtree Accounting. You must register now to continue using Peachtree. You have no unregistered uses left."_  
  This occurs when the trial period has expired and no valid registration key is present.
- **Solution**: Register using a generated key from a compatible key generator (e.g., Peachtree 2010 Key Generator).
  - Launch the **[Peachtree 2010 Key Generator](./Files/gkeygen.exe)** tool.
  - Generate a valid serial number.
  - In the Peachtree registration window:
    - Enter the generated key in the **Serial Number** field.
    - Enter the same key in the **Customer ID** field.
    - Leave the **Recommender ID** field empty.
  - Click **Register** to activate the software.
