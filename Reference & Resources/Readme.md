## IT Staff Performance Evaluation Framework (Qualitative)

This repository contains the **IT Staff Performance Evaluation Framework**, a competency-based, qualitative approach for assessing IT staff performance across diverse roles.

### Overview

- Focuses on **five key competency areas**:  
  _Technical Skills, Problem Solving & Innovation, Work Ethics & Accountability, Communication & Collaboration, Continuous Learning & Development._
- Uses a **1â€“5 Likert scale** to guide ratings, but emphasizes **observed behaviors, context, and evaluator judgment** over strict numerical scoring.
- Designed to align with recognized HR and IT best practices (ISO 30414, ITIL, SHRM competency models).

### Purpose

The framework ensures evaluations are:

- **Qualitative and Contextual** â†’ grounded in actual performance behaviors, not just numbers.
- **Fair and Transparent** â†’ encourages consistency across roles while respecting role-specific nuances.
- **Development-Focused** â†’ supports professional growth, continuous learning, and constructive feedback.

### Scoring Guide

The numeric scale is a **guidance tool** rather than a definitive measure:

- **1** = Needs Improvement
- **2** = Developing
- **3** = Meets Expectations
- **4** = Exceeds Expectations
- **5** = Exceptional

Evaluators are encouraged to add **written observations and context** to supplement the numeric score, ensuring richer feedback and actionable insights.

### Documentation

The complete framework, including criteria, guidance notes, and evaluation templates, is available here:
