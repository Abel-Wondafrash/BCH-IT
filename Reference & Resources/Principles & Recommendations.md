# ðŸŸ¦ Principles & Recommendations

Work is more than just creating or maintaining systems and processes.  
The mindset with which we approach them could mean the difference between **getting by** and **making a difference**.

These principles guide how we engage with our tasks, colleagues, and the wider organization.  
By embracing them, we help preserve continuity and leave systems stronger, more reliable, and easier to manage.

## Guiding Principles

### Integrity

We act with honesty and transparency, guided by an inner commitment to do what is right.  
This means recording what actually happens, acknowledging gaps or mistakes, and avoiding assumptions.  
Integrity compels us to focus on solutions rather than blame, even when challenges cross departmental boundaries or fall outside our immediate responsibilities.

---

### Proactivity

We anticipate potential issues before they arise and take steps to prevent them.  
This includes monitoring systems, planning ahead to avoid recurring problems, and looking for opportunities to streamline and better operations.  
Not waiting until being told to do tasks also means issues are addressed before they get worse.  
Proactivity is also the enabler of doing something we know to be meaningful, rather than just what we are told to do.

---

### Sense of Urgency

We recognize that time is critical.  
With scale, delays â€” even in small tasks â€” can cascade into larger issues.  
We prioritize effectively, act decisively within our sphere, and escalate when needed to prevent unnecessary hold-ups.  
Urgency is a responsible and timely execution that respects both outcomes and people.  
It is our responsibility to demonstrate the urgency of matters through our work, rather than our words, to people who cannot see it.

---

### Dependable Autonomy and Independence

We take ownership of our responsibilities and exercise judgment confidently.  
Though we collaborate and communicate with others, we do not wait for constant permission to act when decisions fall within our sphere.  
We instead act with autonomy and enable ourselves to do so through learning and practicing what we need to, in order to be self-sufficient.

---

### Respect

We approach people with understanding, care, compassion, and respect.  
We listen well and ask questions â€” deeming othersâ€™ views worthy of consideration â€” before making suggestions for improvements.  
This fosters a collaborative and positive working environment where people feel valued and their ideas important.

We also approach our work with the same respect, treating it as an **art worth the effort, time, and attention expended**.  
We take ourselves as craftsmen and take pride in the work we do.

---

### Documentation & Continuity

We document in ways that allow ourselves and others to replicate, refer back to, and continue our work seamlessly.  
This allows for consistent output regardless of who performs the task.

Examples include:

- Creating handover notes
- Recording critical steps
- Maintaining version histories
- Preserving institutional knowledge

This reduces dependency on any single individual.

---

### Communication

We share instructions, decisions, ideas, and information in a way that is easy to understand and follow.  
Clear communication reduces ambiguity, doubt, and misunderstandings.

It helps address issues early, accelerates work completion, and ensures critical information reaches the right people at the right time.

We answer calls promptly and inform callers about any holdups instead of ignoring them, so bottlenecks may be jointly resolved and second-guessing â€” which often leads to frustration â€” can be avoided.

---

### Cross-Functional Awareness

We consider how our actions impact other teams and processes.  
Before implementing changes, we coordinate with stakeholders to ensure improvements:

- Benefit the organization as a whole
- Avoid creating new problems elsewhere
- Prevent reinventing existing solutions
- Deliver tangible, impactful results

---

### Continuous Improvement

We actively seek opportunities to make processes, systems, and interactions better.  
Small, consistent refinements improve efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance overall system reliability over time.

They also keep us sharp and alive, helping us maintain a **day-one attitude and energy**.
